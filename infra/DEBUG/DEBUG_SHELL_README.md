# Roan's Browser UI Debug Shell <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alex313031/Roan's Browser/main/logos/NEW/roansbrowser_debug_shell/icon_256.png" width="36">

## Summary:
This is a special program, built on top of views_examples & content_shell and incorporating a multitude of options for testing, viewing, and debugging UI resources in Roan's Browser. It builds views_examples_with_content, and renames it to roansbrowser_ui_debug_shell. Building views_examples builds the program, but without content_shell linked in (which can be accessed via the *"WebView"* option in the dropdown menu).

## Linux Use
Run the RoansBrowser_Debug_Shell.sh, and you can select from the dropdown menu. Some things are interactive, some load internal resources, and some require loading external resources like viewing .icon files. In that case, you can load a file using its full path in the box towards the bottom.

## Windows Use
Run the roansbrowser_ui_debug_shell.exe, and you can select from the dropdown menu. Some things are interactive, some load internal resources, and some require loading external resources like viewing .icon files. In that case, you can load a file using its full path in the box towards the bottom.

## Use in Roan's Browser
I built this to view and test native Chromium UI icons in the *.icon* format.
These files are in:

//chromium/src/ui/views/vector_icons ## For many subcomponents like native UI views. \
//chromium/src/ui/views/window/vector_icons ## For icons related to the top bar. \
//chromium/src/components/vector_icons ## For components that affect many build targets. \
//chromium/src/chrome/app/vector_icons ## For icons only used in the browser. \
//chromium/src/ash/resources/vector_icons ## For icons used in Chromium on ChromiumOS. \
//chromium/src/chromeos/ui/vector_icons ## For icons specific to ChromiumOS. \
//chromium/src/chromecast/ui/vector_icons ## For icons specific to ChromeCast.

To build, use: autoninja -C out/roansbrowser chrome chromedriver roansbrowser_shell setup mini_installer roansbrowser_ui_debug_shell or just
autoninja -C out/roansbrowser roansbrowser_ui_debug_shell to exclude building the rest of Roan's Browser.
