These set build arguments for ninja (the Chromium build system) to parse and apply. Roan's Browser has many set, and they vary from platform to platform, and whether or not it is a Debug build. This document explains what they do, why they are set a certain way in Roan's Browser, and options available.

## API Keys
google_api_key = "" &#35;&#35; Set Google API Key. Unset in public Roan's Browser repository.

google_default_client_id = "" &#35;&#35; Set the Client ID. Unset in public Roan's Browser repository.

google_default_client_secret = "" &#35;&#35; Set the Client Secret. All three must be set to use Google Sync, Translate, etc. Unset in public Roan's Browser repository. You can make and set your own by following https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/api-keys/. &#35;&#35; NOTE: Roan's Browser contributers, contact me for access to the private API_KEYS repo.

## Experimental
is_chancie_wancie_build &#35;&#35; Build the CrOS version of ffmpeg. Used for testing, I.E. to enable HEVC on Linux. Will break Windows/Android/Fuchsia builds. Contact me for info on usage cases and testing.

## MacOS
use_system_xcode = true &#35;&#35; Whether to use the local XCode. Only applicable on Mac, and must be enabled, as only internal Chrome builds have this set to false to use an internal checkout of XCode.

## Cross-Building
target_os &#35;&#35; Set the target Operating System. I.E. linux, win, mac, chromeos, fuchsia.

target_cpu &#35;&#35; Set the target CPU. I.E. x86, x64, arm, arm64, mipsel, mips64el, and ppc. Can be used to cross-compile. When using arm/arm64, you should set compiler options in //roansbrowser/build/config/arm.gni

is_component_ffmpeg &#35;&#35; Builds ffmpeg as a shared library even when is_component_build is false or is_official build is true. Enabled on Linux, so users can swap out libffmpeg.so for a FOSS one or different one, I.E a different version or from something like Opera or Vivaldi for extra Codec support. &#35;&#35; NOTE: Should be disabled on Mac, because building the installer will fail. Also, should be disabled on Windows, as it causes the compatibility mode bug on Win 10/11. &#35;&#35; TODO: Look into fixing on Windows, so that users can swap out ffmpeg.dll for another one.

use_webaudio_ffmpeg &#35;&#35; Use ffmpeg for computing FFT's (Fast Fourier Transform) in audio streams. Disabled in Roan's Browser for performance, and because of bugs when building for AVX.

use_webaudio_pffft &#35;&#35; Use the pffft library for computing FFT's in audio streams. Enabled in Roan's Browser for performance EXCEPT on MacOS, because the native FFT library there is much faster. See > https://bitbucket.org/jpommier/pffft/src

When enabled, it cannot be updated as its version is hard coded and tied with the chrome executable, and will not show in chrome://components as it is not built as a component. When disabled, it functions as a component and is downloaded with other components from Google servers to the user profile dir. Disabled in Roan's Browser for transparency, and so that it can be updated irrespective of the Roan's Browser version. Also disabled to make use of the widevine patches for Roan's Browser on Linux. Could technically be enabled on Windows. Only enabled in RoansBrowserOS, with the widevine patches in that repository.

ignore_missing_widevine_signing_cert &#35;&#35; Set whether to ignore Widevine CDM host verification signing due to no signing cert, regardless of is_official_build. Enabled in Roan's Browser to mitigate possible Widevine issues.
